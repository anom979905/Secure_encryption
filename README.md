### Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to develop a software tool that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files and directories using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in CFB (Cipher Feedback) mode. This tool is designed to:

1. **Protect Confidentiality**: Ensure that sensitive information within files and directories is kept confidential and inaccessible to unauthorized users. This is achieved through strong encryption that requires a password to decrypt.

2. **Secure Data Transmission and Storage**: Facilitate secure data storage and transmission by encrypting files before they are stored or sent over insecure networks. This helps in protecting data from potential breaches or unauthorized access.

3. **Ease of Use**: Provide a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting files and directories. Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt individual files or entire directories, making it versatile for various use cases.

4. **Password-Based Encryption**: Use a password-derived cryptographic key for encryption, making it straightforward for users to remember and manage their encryption keys securely. The key is derived from the password using a strong key derivation function (PBKDF2HMAC), enhancing security.

5. ****Handling Large Files and Directories**: Ensure that the software can handle files and directories of varying sizes, making it suitable for both small and large datasets.

Overall, this project aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for data encryption and decryption, addressing the need for secure file and directory management in both personal and professional contexts.


### How to Use the Encryption/Decryption Software

**1. Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Create a virtual environment and install required libraries:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install cryptography
     ```
   - Save the provided code into a Python file, for example, `file_encryptor.py`.

**2. Running the Software:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `file_encryptor.py` is saved.
   - Activate the virtual environment if it's not already active:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python file_encryptor.py
     ```

**3. Encrypting Files or Directories:**
   - When prompted, choose `(E)ncrypt` for encryption.
   - Enter the password you want to use for encryption. Ensure it's a strong and memorable password.
   - Provide the path to the file or directory you want to encrypt. The script will process the specified path:
     - **For a file:** The file will be encrypted and overwritten with the encrypted content.
     - **For a directory:** All files within the directory will be encrypted.

**4. Decrypting Files or Directories:**
   - When prompted, choose `(D)ecrypt` for decryption.
   - Enter the same password used for encryption.
   - Provide the path to the encrypted file or directory. The script will process the specified path:
     - **For a file:** The encrypted file will be decrypted and overwritten with the original content.
     - **For a directory:** All files within the directory will be decrypted.

**5. Handling Errors:**
   - If you encounter any issues, check the error message for details. Common issues might include incorrect file paths or mismatched passwords.

**6. Important Notes:**
   - Ensure that the provided path exists and is accessible.
   - Use strong and unique passwords to maintain the security of encrypted data.
   - The script currently handles files and directories but does not manage nested directories or large-scale data efficiently. Consider implementing chunk-based processing for very large files.

By following these steps, you can use the software to securely encrypt and decrypt files and directories, ensuring the confidentiality and protection of your data.
